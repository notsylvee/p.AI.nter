Our shared prison. So he asked me to delay the retrival of the Crystal for as long as possible. I'm sorry for any... inconvenience I might have caused in the process. I... don't want to go back to Roblux mining... It's soo... mind numbing I... can't bear it longer... I just want to make art again... Sebastian will come back for me whenever he finds a way out.
